# Privacy Policy for Pranaam

**Effective Date:** 2025-12-15

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Pranaam ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices when you use our mobile application, Pranaam (the "App").

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our Service:

### 2.1 Personal Information

- **Phone Number:** We collect your phone number to authenticate your account (via OTP) and to identify you within the App.
- **Name:** We collect the name you provide to create your user profile.

### 2.2 Contact Information (Contact List)

- **Contacts Access:** With your explicit permission, the App accesses your device's contact list (`READ_CONTACTS` permission).
- **Data Transmitted:** We collect and transmit phone numbers from your address book to our servers.
- **Purpose:** This data is used solely to identify which of your contacts are already registered users of Pranaam, allowing you to connect with them ("Find Friends").
- **Storage & Usage:** The phone numbers are normalized and sent to our backend (Supabase) to query against our registered user database. We do not permanently store your non-user contact's information on our servers. The matching results are cached locally on your device to improve performance.

### 2.3 Device and Usage Information

- **Device Identifiers:** We may collect device identifiers and tokens (specifically Firebase Cloud Messaging - FCM Token) to send you push notifications.
- **Usage Data:** We collect data about your interactions with the App, such as greetings sent and received.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **Authentication:** To verify your identity and secure your account using One-Time Passwords (OTP).
- **Social Features:** To connect you with friends and family who also use the App by matching phone numbers from your contact list.
- **Communication:** To send you greetings, notifications, and updates via Push Notifications.
- **Service Improvement:** To analyze usage patterns and improve the App's functionality and user experience.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your data with third-party service providers who assist us in operating the App:

- **Supabase:** We use Supabase for authentication, database hosting, and backend logic. Your personal data (Name, Phone Number) is stored securely on Supabase servers.
- **Firebase (Google):** We use Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver push notifications. Device tokens are shared with Firebase to facilitate this service.

We may also disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data. All communication between the App and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Your Rights

- **Access:** You can view your profile information within the App.
- **Correction:** You can update your profile name within the App.
- **Account Deletion:** If you wish to delete your account and associated data, please contact us at the support email provided below (or use the deletion feature if available in the App).
- **Permissions:** You can revoke the Contacts permission at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the "Find Friends" functionality.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
